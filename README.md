### Hi, this is Gokhan Ensep ğŸ‘‹

I'm currently working for Kuehne+Nagel company as Senior Software Engineer and living in Tallin, Estonia.

I'm interesting in useful tech stacks to make my development life easier.

I'm not only Software Engineer, also interesting in cloud infrastructure design and development with Kubernetes like a platform engineer or devops. I have experience with AWS and Google Cloud. Infrastructure as a Code is my main approach to develop something in this area or any development phase.

So, I develop high available, maintainable and scalable applications to make people's life with easier.

I apply clean code and design pattern principles to develop loosely-coupled, extendable, easy-maintainable projects considering time and space complexity. 

There is not only one way to do any task. I mostly would like to make sure of that whether I applied the best practices or not. If not, it disturbs me every moment.
